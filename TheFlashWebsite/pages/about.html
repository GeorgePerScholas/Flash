	<p>My name is Barry Allen.</p><p>And I am the fastest man alive.</p><p> When I was a child I saw my mother killed by something impossible. My father went to prison for her murder. Then an accident made me the impossible. To the outside world I am an ordinary forensic scientist, but secretly with the help of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs I fight crime and find other metahumans like me.</p> <p>I hunted down the man who killed my mother, but in doing so I opened up our world to new threats, and I am the only one fast enough to stop them. After defeating Zoom and saving the multiverse, I ran back in time and created the alternate timeline "Flashpoint". I restored the timeline to how it was, only to find things weren't as I left them. I brought new threats to our world, and I'm the only one fast enough to stop them. </p>
